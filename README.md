# Aquarium Telegram Bot
 An ESP8266 Telegram Bot for lights control and temperature monitoring of your aquarium

## Features: 
- Uses WifiManager to configure WiFi Connection and Botfather Token
- Timed/Manual Control of RGB + W LED lights
- Read SHT30 Temperature and Humidity Sensor on the I2C bus

## Setup 
1. Use PlatformIO to buld and upload the code to your ESP8266
2. Connect to the ESP8266's hotspot and key in your WiFi details, as well as the Botfather Token
3. Wait for it to reboot and enjoy your IoT-enabled aquarium!

I will be adding more documentation, but probably will not be adding more features or maintaining this repo. Feel free to fork it and customise your own IoT-enabled aquarium! :)
